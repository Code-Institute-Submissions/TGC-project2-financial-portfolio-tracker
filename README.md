# TGC-CI-Project2
### financial-portfolio-tracker

There are quite alot of good portfolio tracker both free & paid in the market. I pick this api project particularly of my interest in the topic of investment and trading.
I will start with a simple crypto tracker/dashboard for crypto tradings that can show total portfolio and the coins/tokens on hand so user will have a overview of their assets.

## UX
Its is a financial dashboard to show essential information, so i think a minimalist design approach will be good as the main focus point is the data presented.
color choice will use grey for the background and white on the card components to differentiate the data display area, the display chart will use different color on each coins/tokens to contrast the portfolio assets.

## UI
Its a one page dashboard to show user their portfolio data, All data are displayed in a structured card elements & charts display are incorporated to help users better visualize their data, more info will be display when user hover above the pie chart for every coins/tokens.
